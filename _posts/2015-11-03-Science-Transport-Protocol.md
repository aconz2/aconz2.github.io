After being in and around the academic research community for a while as an
undergraduate, I have noticed many things which I think can be improved.
Furthermore, I would claim the current state of affairs in regards to
scientific journal publishers needs to be greatly improved in order to ensure
the scientific progress modern society demands. For an English class as an
undergraduate, I prepared a grant proposal for developing a standardized
scientific publication tool which would bring many benefits.

I will link to the full paper below and would be thrilled if you read it. Since
it is on github, I encourage discussion or pull requests. There are a few key
points which are important to keep in mind when reading it.

  - The *thing* being developed is a standard protocol -- think HTTP, SMTP, FTP
    etc.
  - Publishers (or other companies) can still sell a product *on-top* of this
    protocol so long as there is value added (just like email). Examples could
be:
    - Nicer interfaces for viewing articles (just like *some* people pay for
      nicer email clients)
    - Hosting of a server supporting this protocol (just like email)
    - Uniform editing or formatting of articles
  - The end goal is to make free the default and not the afterthought
  - The growing maker movement, hacker culture, etc. are testament to public
    participation in science and an open protocol for doing so could bring
exciting new ideas

Without further ado, here is the
