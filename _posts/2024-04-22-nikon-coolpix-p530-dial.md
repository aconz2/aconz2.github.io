Nikon Coolpix P530 was sporadically switching into differnt modes even without changing the knob. Using the knob would inconsistently change modes.

Took apart with 00 Philips bit, all screws same size except 1 longer one on the bottom of the grip. 1 screw under the HDMI/USB cover. Deploy flash and looking from the front, there is a small recess that looks perfect for a flat head screwdriver, insert one to pry the halves apart.

All I did was spray compressed air up into the dial so maybe try that before taking apart. It seems to be improved for now but limited testing so far.
