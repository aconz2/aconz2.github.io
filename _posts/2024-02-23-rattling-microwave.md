New Samsung microwave was vibrating/rattling/making-bad-noise more often than not

Initially convinced myself it wasn't the air grease filters

Would sometimes go away pushing up on the front right corner

After removing the lower panel, everything seemed solid except the filters

Discovered I had broken the bulb from tapping on the glass window in trying to trace the noise source

Easy fix was to take the filters out, slightly bend them front-to-back and reinsert (they go in the rear slot and keep pushing, then bring forward to latch) so that they have some pre-tension and aren't making noise anymore
