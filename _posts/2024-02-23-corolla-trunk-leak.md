Noticed condensation on rear windshield and rear speakers were going bad

Found a large pool of water sitting in the spare tire well and corrosion on the speakers

Removed trunk interior panels and found some more in the side well by the vent

Removed rubber plugs to drain and let dry

Poured a few gallons of water on rear windshield and found what I think is the entry point: water getting in the weatherstripping groove and making its way down to the latch, then going into the spare tire well

This explains why there was no wetness on the carpet

Observed small leaks coming from the side vents too, but have not addressed these yet

Used 3M Black Super Weatherstrip Adhesive to reglue the entire weatherstripping after cleaning and working in sections

Started from the latch which had a small center mark

2oz tube was just enough

I had previously noticed the weatherstripping had pulled up some times after a cable harness on the trunk lid snagged it but ignored it

Reattached the cable harness with the plastic clip and zip tied it
