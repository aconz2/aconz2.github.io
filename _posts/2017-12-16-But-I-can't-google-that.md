I read a lot about programming related things on the internet: blogs, papers, comment sections, slides, conference talks. Since I'm particularly interested in programming languages, I'm always excited to see something about one come up; whether its one I've never heard of or something I use everyday, there's typically a tidbit of knowledge either in the content itself or buried in the comments section. Despite how awful ~~some~~ most comment sections ~~can become~~ are, my thirst for new (and old for that matter) ideas keeps me wading through the muck.

I don't want to drone on about the downsides of comment sections because like I said, I occasionally find interesting links, arguments, opinions, experiences, etc. that would be hard to come by anywhere else. That being said, here is a very common comment that I see under anything programming language related:

> &lt;Language Name&gt; seems cool, but its such a horrible name because you can't google for it

This provides no value and is such a silly thing to say. Let's ramble off a list of programming languages that have names that have obvious [homographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homograph):

    - Ruby
    - Python
    - Java
    - Swift
    - Go
    - Rust
    - Scratch
    - Alice
    - Dart
    - Crystal
    - Julia
    - Groovy
    - Pony

And a bunch of single letter ones which provide little clue to google:

    - C
    - C#
    - C++
    - D
    - F#
    - J
    - K
    - R

It makes me chuckle to think about a marketing director chiming in at a Ford meeting, "We really need to change our lineup of car names to something a little more google-friendly. All of these are too hard for consumers to find: mustang, fiesta, focus, fusion, explorer, escape".

There's another related comment that looks like this:

> You should pick another name because &lt;Language Name&gt; is already used for &lt;Something Else&gt;

Those people are in for a real treat when they open a dictionary and find multiple definitions all over the place. The horror!

Anyways, I'm just a little tired of seeing these things all over programming language related comment sections. A post for another day is explaining why I think the prevalence of google and stackoverflow for finding answers is a symptom of a deep problem in how we program. That will be more interesting than this rant.
