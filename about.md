I am a freelance software engineer specializing in integrations. Moving data from one place to another is my jam and I'd be happy to discuss how to help streamline your business. Contact info is in the footer.

I have a CS degree University of Maryland, College Park where I did an honors thesis in computational biology.

I like to think about things and go rock climbing.
